My research focus
======
During my PhD, I will be focussing on cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently I am working on a dataset of magnetoencephalography data recorded during a working memory task from healthy controls and MS patients. 


The goal of this website
======
This website will be used to share [publications](https://lcosters.github.io/publications) and their code, and [presentations and posters](https://lcosters.github.io/presentations).
